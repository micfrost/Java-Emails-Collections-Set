# Email List Management System Using HashSet

## Overview
This Java application is designed to manage an email list by allowing users to add and view unique email addresses. Utilizing a `HashSet`, the program automatically enforces the uniqueness of each email address, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

- **Display Emails**: The program displays all unique email addresses currently stored.
- **Exit Option**: Allows users to exit the program gracefully.

## How to Use
1. Run `Main.java` to start the program.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to add or view email addresses.
3. Choose the 'Exit' option to terminate the application.
